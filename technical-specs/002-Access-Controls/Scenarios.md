# Overview
App Center has roles that can only be applied broadly across all the services within the portal and through the API's. There are currently 4 roles that define what a user can do with an app's configuration and data, but we frequently hear requests for more options.

## Built-in Roles
Managers can manage app settings, collaborators, and integrations
Developers can manage app services (e.g. create builds, run tests)
Testers can install apps they are distribution group members of
Viewers access is limited to a read-only state

# Scenarios

## Roles

1. Managers can create, update and delete additional roles
2. Managers cannot create, update and delete the 4 built-in default roles
3. Managers can edit a roles permissions

## Role Permissions
Custom roles will include the ability to include or exclude access to a specific service along with a permission set focused on functionality within the service itself.

 2. Can delete build configuration
 3. Can start a build
 4. Can delete a build

### Identity

## Teams
With an existing `Team` structure already in place the assumption is this serves as a logical fit for security group management.

1. Managers can create a `Team` and limit the services members have access to see
2. Managers can create a `Team` and limit functionality within a service members have access to use

## App Security
1. Managers can lock down an app to users belonging to a specific corporate domain
2. Managers can lock down an org to users belonging to a specific corporate domain
3. Managers can be secure app releases behind an authenticated web address

## Traceability
1. Managers, developers and viewers can view an audit trail of actions performed by users to track changes within App Center
